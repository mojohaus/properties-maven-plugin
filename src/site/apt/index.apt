Properties Maven Plugin

  The Properties Maven Plugin is here to make life a little easier when dealing
  with properties.  It provides goals to read properties from files and URLs and write
  properties to files, and also to set system properties.

  It's main use-case is loading properties from files or URLs instead of declaring them in
  <pom.xml>, something that comes in handy when dealing with different environments.

  If you have a properties file called <teams.properties> with this content:

----------------------------------------
  toronto=raptors
  miami=heat
----------------------------------------

  and invoke the {{{./read-project-properties-mojo.html}properties:read-project-properties}}
  goal, it would be the same as declaring the following in your <pom.xml>:

----------------------------------------
  <properties>
    <toronto>raptors</toronto>
    <miami>heat</miami>
  </properties>
----------------------------------------

  The properties loaded from files or URLs can be used to filter resources
  differently for different environments.  Those using Spring's
  {{{http://www.springframework.org/docs/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PropertyResourceConfigurer.html}PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer}}
  can see how these goals can be useful. Note that the URL format accepts
  Spring's classpath: style pseudo-URL syntax.
