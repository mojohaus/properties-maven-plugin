# Usurped by the Cotiviti Release Process

This plugin has two changes to it that are functional:

* There is a [patch](https://github.com/mojohaus/properties-maven-plugin/pull/31) that fixes the active-profiles goal in the original plugin
* There is an additional goal called write-server-keys-as-json that writes all the server keys into the target `outputFile` in a JSON format
